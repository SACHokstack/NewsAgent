- **Intelligent Content Analysis**: Automatically extracts headlines, locations, and critical information
- **War Correspondent Style**: Transforms formal news into dramatic frontline reporting
- **Professional Voice Synthesis**: Converts scripts into broadcast-ready audio with emotional inflection
- **Customizable Output**: Adjust speaking rate and emotion settings for different segments

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask with Python
- **OCR**: landingaiAI OCR for text extraction
- **NLP**: Custom sentence ranking & landingai/Groq for structured data extraction
- **Voice Synthesis**: Zyphra API for realistic news reporter voices
- **Frontend**: HTML/JS/CSS (not included in the repository)
